# Hi there, I'm Keane, aka Keawe! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I explore the world of **CTF challenges** and **Computer Engineering**!

## 🧠 About Me

- 🎓 **Computer Engineering** undergraduate with a passion for technology, problem-solving, and ethical hacking.
- 🕵️ **OSINT enthusiast** – love unraveling mysteries and finding answers in data, much like my favorite detective **Sherlock Holmes**.
- 💻 I'm working on various **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges, with a focus on **OSINT**, but I also explore other areas like **cryptography** and **forensics**.
- 📚 Constantly learning and applying new things in **machine learning**, **security research**, and **software development**.
  
## 🚀 My Projects & Writeups

### 🔐 **CTF Writeups**
Check out my collection of CTF writeups, where I document my solutions and thought processes from various CTF events:
